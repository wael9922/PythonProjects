# Python Projects Portfolio

## About This Portfolio

This portfolio showcases a collection of Python projects demonstrating my programming skills, particularly in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), data handling, and real-world problem solving. Each project highlights different aspects of Python, including class design, exception handling, inheritance, and functional programming.

## Projects Included

### 1. Library Management System

**Description:** A system to manage books and library users. It includes adding, removing, searching, borrowing, and returning books, as well as registering users and tracking their borrowed books.

* Skills: OOP, Exception Handling, List Comprehension, Class Design.
* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/wael9922/PythonProjects/tree/main/Library%20System%20Project)

### 2. OOP Bank Account Project

**Description:** A banking simulation that allows creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing funds, transferring money, and handling insufficient balance with custom exceptions. Includes specialized account types like interest reward accounts and savings accounts with fees.

* Skills: OOP, Inheritance, Method Overriding, Exception Handling.
* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/wael9922/PythonProjects/tree/main/Bank%20System%20Project)

## Key Skills Demonstrated

* Object-Oriented Programming: classes, methods, inheritance, encapsulation.
* Exception handling for robust and user-friendly applications.
* Designing reusable and extendable Python code.
* Applying Python to real-world scenarios like library and banking systems.
* Clean code practices and project organization.
