# Python Projects Portfolio

## About This Portfolio

This portfolio showcases a collection of Python projects demonstrating my programming skills, particularly in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), data handling, GUI development, and real-world problem solving. Each project highlights different aspects of Python, including class design, exception handling, inheritance, functional programming, and user interface development.

## Projects Included

### 1. Library Management System
**Description:** A system to manage books and library users. It includes adding, removing, searching, borrowing, and returning books, as well as registering users and tracking their borrowed books.

* **Skills:** OOP, Exception Handling, List Comprehension, Class Design
